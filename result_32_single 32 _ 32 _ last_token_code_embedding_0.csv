```python
def split_lowerstring(s):
    return [s[i+1:] for i in range(len(s)-1) if s[i].islower()]

This function works by iterating over the string `s`. For each character, it checks if the character is lowercase using the `islower()` method. If the character is lowercase, it splits the string at that point and adds the split string to a list. The function then returns the list of split strings.

Please note that the function returns all the strings after the lowercase letter, not the ones before. If you want to include the lowercase letter in the split strings, you can modify the function like this:

```python
def split_lowerstring(s):
    return [s[i+1:] if s[i].islower() else s[i] + s[i+1:] for i in range(len(s)-1)]

In this function, we are using two nested loops to iterate through possible values of i and j. For each pair (i, j), we check whether i^2 - j^2 equals to the given number n. If such a pair is found, we return True as the given number can be represented as difference of two squares. If no such pair is found after checking all possible pairs, we return False.

Please note that this function assumes that the given number is non-negative. If negative numbers can be part of the input, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.

def sort_sublists(lst):

```

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the given list. For each sublist, it sorts the elements using the `sorted` function, which takes a key function as an argument. The key function is a lambda function that strips leading and trailing whitespace from each string. This ensures that the sorting is performed on the ""clean"" version of the strings. The sorted sublist is then included in the final result.

This function works by first checking if the input list is empty or not. If it is, it returns an empty string. Then, it sets the prefix to be the first string in the list. It then iterates over the remaining strings, and for each string, it removes the last character of the prefix until it is a prefix of the string. If at any point the prefix becomes an empty string, it returns an empty string. Finally, it returns the common prefix.

The function first sorts the input list of strings. After sorting, the first string in the sorted list is the lexicographically smallest string, and the last string is the lexicographically largest string. Since the strings are sorted, the longest common prefix will be the common prefix of the first and last strings.

The function then iterates over the characters of the first string. If the character at position `i` is the same in both the first and last strings, it is added to the prefix. If the characters differ, the loop is broken and the current prefix is returned.

In this function, we are converting the list to a set. A set in Python is a collection of unique elements. By converting the list to a set, we are effectively removing all duplicate elements. If all elements in the list are the same, the set will contain only one element. If there are different elements, the set will contain more than one element. By checking the length of the set, we can determine if all elements in the list are the same or not. If the length of the set is 1, all elements are the same, so the function returns True. If the length of the set is more than 1, the elements are not all the same, so the function returns False.

This function iterates over all numbers from 0 to n (inclusive). It checks if the i-th bit is set (by using the bitwise AND operator), and if the first and last bits of the binary representation of i are both set. If both conditions are met, it increments the count.

In the test cases, the function should return the following:

```python
assert count_Num(2) == 1
assert count_Num(3) == 2
assert count_Num(1) == 1
```

The function `count_Num` takes an integer n as input and returns the count of numbers whose 0th and nth bits are set. The function uses a for loop to iterate over all numbers from 0 to n (inclusive), and a conditional statement to check if the 0th and nth bits are set. The count is incremented if both conditions are met.

In this function, we iterate from 0 to n (inclusive).

If both conditions are satisfied, we increment the counter. Finally, we return the counter.

assert replace_max_specialchar('ram reshma,ram rahim',1)==('ram:reshma,ram rahim')
```

In this function, we first count the number of spaces, commas, and dots in the string `s`. We then find the character that occurs the most times and replace its nth occurrence with a colon. The `n` parameter specifies how many occurrences of the most common character to replace. If `n` is greater than the number of occurrences of the most common character, all occurrences will be replaced.

The function `lps` takes a string `s` as input and returns the length of the longest palindromic subsequence. The dynamic programming table `dp` is initialized with all elements set to 0. Then for each substring of `s`, the function checks if the first and last characters are the same.

Explanation:

The function `dog_age` takes a parameter `human_years` which represents the age of a person in human years.

The first two years of a dog's life is equivalent to 10.5 human years, so if the human age is less than or equal to 2, the function returns the product of `human_years` and 10.5.

From the third year onwards, a dog year is equivalent to 4 human years. So, if the human age is more than 2, the function returns the sum of 21 (which is the equivalent of the first two years) and the product of the difference between `human_years` and 2 and 4.

This is a simple way to convert human years to dog years.

If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it into the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that this closing bracket does not have a matching opening bracket, so it increments the count of unbalanced brackets. If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element from the stack. This is because the top element in the stack is the matching opening bracket for the current closing bracket.

```python
def swap_count(brackets):

print(swap_count(""[[][]]""))  # Output: 0

```

This function works by treating the string as a series of brackets and using a stack to keep track of the opening brackets that have not been matched with a closing bracket yet. The number of swaps is equal to the number of unmatched opening brackets, plus the number of extra closing brackets at the end of the string.

This function works by iterating over each bracket in the string. If it encounters an opening bracket, it increments `open_br` by 1. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if `open_br` is 0.

This function works by iterating over the two input tuples in parallel using `zip`. For each pair of numbers `(a, b)`, it performs the bitwise xor operation `a ^ b` and returns a new tuple. The `tuple` function is used to convert the result back into a tuple.

You can test this function with the provided test cases:

```python
assert bitwise_xor((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (15, 6, 5, 10)
assert bitwise_xor((11, 5, 7, 10), (6, 3, 4, 4)) == (13, 6, 3, 14)
assert bitwise_xor((12, 6, 8, 11), (7, 4, 5, 6)) == (11, 2, 13, 13)
